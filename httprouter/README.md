# httprouter

Package httprouter provides "plumbing" primitives for building web applications.
It is not a framework but rather a set of simple utilities that can be used independently of each other.

Welcome to the httprouter user guide. Here we will guide you through some
practical examples of how to interact with the API.

# Getting started
