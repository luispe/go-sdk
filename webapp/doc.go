/*
Package webapp provides different primitives for working with
applications within the web environment.

Welcome to the webapp user guide. Here we will guide you through some
practical examples of how to interact with the API.

A webapp.Application is what most people will end up using, this struct
is just container of other components exposed by the "go-toolkit",
constructed with sane defaults, compliant with the behavior that's expected
from an application working in the web environment.
